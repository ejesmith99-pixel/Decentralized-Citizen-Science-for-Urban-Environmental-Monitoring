# 🌍 Decentralized Citizen Science for Urban Environmental Monitoring

Welcome to an innovative decentralized app that transforms how urban communities monitor and improve their local environment! This project tackles the real-world problem of urban environmental degradation by enabling citizens to collect and share data on air quality, noise pollution, and urban heat islands. Built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts, it rewards contributors for verified data, ensures transparency, and empowers cities to make data-driven decisions for sustainability.

## ✨ Features

📍 Submit geo-tagged environmental data (e.g., air quality, noise levels, temperature) with evidence hashes  
✅ Community-driven validation to ensure data accuracy and filter spam  
💸 Reward contributors and validators with tokens based on data quality and impact  
🔒 Immutable ledger for urban environmental data, accessible to city planners and researchers  
🗳️ Governance for proposing new data types or reward structures  
📊 Queryable analytics for trends (e.g., pollution hotspots or heat island maps)  
🌐 Oracle integration for cross-verifying data with external sensors  
🚫 Anti-fraud measures via staking and slashing mechanisms  
🛒 Marketplace for trading verified environmental data NFTs  
🔄 Modular design with 8 smart contracts for scalability

## 🛠 How It Works

This dApp uses 8 Clarity smart contracts to create a robust, decentralized system for urban environmental monitoring. Here's how they fit together:

### Smart Contracts Overview
1. **UserRegistry.clar**: Registers users, tracks profiles, and manages reputation scores for contributors and validators.
2. **DataTypeRegistry.clar**: Maintains a list of trackable environmental data types (e.g., PM2.5, decibels, temperature), updatable via governance.
3. **DataSubmission.clar**: Enables submission of environmental observations, including geo-tags, timestamps, and evidence hashes (e.g., sensor readings).
4. **ValidationPool.clar**: Manages a pool of staked validators who review and vote on data submissions for accuracy.
5. **GreenToken.clar**: A SIP-10 compliant token contract for issuing rewards to contributors and validators.
6. **StakingMechanism.clar**: Allows users to stake tokens to become validators, with penalties for malicious actions.
7. **EnvLedger.clar**: Stores validated environmental data in an immutable ledger, queryable for analytics and urban planning.
8. **GovernanceDAO.clar**: Enables token holders to propose and vote on system upgrades, such as new data types or reward adjustments.

**For Contributors (Citizens)**  
- Register through UserRegistry to participate.  
- Use DataSubmission to upload environmental data: specify data type (from DataTypeRegistry), location, timestamp, and a hash of your evidence (e.g., sensor data or photo).  
- After validation by the ValidationPool, earn GreenToken rewards based on data quality and relevance.  

Boom! Your data helps cities track and address environmental issues transparently!
